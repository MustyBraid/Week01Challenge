This is Casey Chartier's submission for the week 1 assignment.

Given starter code in both CSS and HTMl, I have reworked the code to use classes more efficiently and meet
accessibility standards through the use of alt text for images. Readability has also been improved by renaming HTML elements and reorganizing their structure so that it better flows with the website's design and the CSS code that accompanies it. An appropriate title has been added as well.

 This was a lot of fun! I'm looking forward to the rest of the class.
